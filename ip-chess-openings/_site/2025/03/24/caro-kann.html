<p>The Caro-Kann Defense is one of the most popular openings in response to the King’s Pawn Opening.</p>

  <li>e4 c6
Black responds with 1….c6 with the idea of thrusting forward with d5 on the next move, attacking the white central pawn on e4. The Caro-Kann Defense is one of the few defenses in chess where black can reach equality in the main line and many people would consider black to have a better position, especially in the end game when the main line is played out. This is usually because black does not compromise his pawn structure and will usually have an easier end game.</li>

<p>The Caro-Kann is a somewhat complicated opening with several respected variations. On White’s second move, 2.d4 is by far the most common. The main exception to know is the Two Knights Defense (1.e4 c6 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3).</p>
