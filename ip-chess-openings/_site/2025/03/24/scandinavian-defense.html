<p>The Scandinavian Defense is one of the oldest recorded openings in chess. From the very first move, black looks to undermine the center control of white after the common e4 move by white.</p>

  <li>e4 d5
Nine times out of ten white will capture the pawn on d5 and I recommend that you spend the majority of your time learning the Scandinavian Defense, assuming that white captures the pawn on d5.</li>

<p>The Scandinavian Defense can actually be considered the oldest opening in chess! This is because it is the opening used in the first known recorded game of chess. Despite its early start, the Scandinavian does not appear in any other known game until 1839.</p>
