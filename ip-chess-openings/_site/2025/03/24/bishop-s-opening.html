<p>The Bishop’s Opening is one of the oldest openings in chess but has fallen out of favor recently. It starts with the moves:</p>
<ol>
  <li>e4 e5</li>
  <li>Bc4
White decides to develop the light square bishop before bringing the knight to f3. The three main responses from black are 2…Nf6, 2…Nc6, and 2…Bc5. White has good chances against each of these lines and can fall into more popular opening variations if they choose.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Bishop’s Opening is a chess opening that begins with the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 White attacks Black’s f7-square and prevents Black from advancing the d-pawn to d5. By ignoring the beginner’s maxim “develop knights before bishops “, White leaves their f-pawn unblocked, preserving the possibility of f2-f4.</p>
