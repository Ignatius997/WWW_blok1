<p>The Albin Counter-Gambit is a hyper aggressive defense for black against the ever so popular queens gambit from white.</p>
<ol>
  <li>d4 d5</li>
  <li>c4 e5
Black gives up his pawn on e5 so that his d pawn can be nicely placed on d4. This pawn is a huge thorn in the side of white and there are many trap that come from the Albin Counter-Gambit that white has to be on the lookout for. One of the most common traps in the Albin Counter-Gambit is the Lasker Trap which punishes white if he tries to attack the pawn on d4 with e3.</li>
