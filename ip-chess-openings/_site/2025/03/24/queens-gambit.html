The objective of the queen’s gambit is to temporarily sacrifice a pawn to gain control of the center of the board.
If black accepts the gambit 2…dxc4 white should reply 3. e3 which not only gives the d4 pawn an extra defender but also frees up the bishop to attack and regain the pawn. Black will have a hard time holding onto the pawn after 3…b5 4. a4 c6 5. axb5 cxb5 6. Qf3. In the Queen’s Gambit accepted line, white is able to gain a center presence, good attacking chances and his pawn on d4 threatens to advance. Black will have to concede his pawn on c4 and focus on counter attacking white’s advances. This is why the queen’s gambit is not considered to be a true gambit. There are many different variations for black if they choose to decline the gambit.</li>
