<p>Larsens Opening is a change of pace from the typical openings where white looks to control the center of the board with this d and e pawns.  Instead white will play his bishop to b2 and control the dark square diagonal which will put pressure on black’s king side.
This is not an aggressive opening but does give white many favorable positions and also is poorly prepared for by black.
If white wants to play more aggressive he can always play e3 followed by f4 and start to push forward on the king side.  While e3 isn’t common, in Larsens Opening is makes a lot of sense because the dark square bishop is already out of the pawn chain on b2.</p>

<p>Like most openings that do not begin with 1.e4 or 1.d4, Larsen’s Opening is immediately identifiable from White’s first move. It is the sixth-most popular opening move for White in the Chess.com Masters database after 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.c4, 1.Nf3, and 1.g3. Pros. May lead to strong pressure down the long diagonal;</p>
