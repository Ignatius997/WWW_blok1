<p>The Italian Game is one of the oldest openings in chess. After 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 white looks to centralize more material by bringing his bishop to c4. While this is a very active square early on, this opening can many times become a very quiet and slow game. Both sides of the board look to stabilize without trading off any material.</p>

  <li>e4 e5</li>
  <li>Nf3 Nc6</li>
  <li>Bc4
The good news is that there are many aggressive variations that white can play to open the game up. If black plays Bc5 then white can play the Evanâ€™s Gambit (4. b4) or the Italian Gambit (4. d4).</li>
