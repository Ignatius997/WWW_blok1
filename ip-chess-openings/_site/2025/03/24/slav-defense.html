<p>The Slav Defense is one of the most popular openings with GM’s. This is for two reasons. The first is that it is one of the most solid lines to play against the Queens Gambit and with the Queens Gambit being a regular opening at high level play, many top players have become fans of this opening.</p>

<p>The Slav Defense is a chess opening that begins with the moves: 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6. The Slav is one of the primary defenses to the Queen’s Gambit. Although it was analyzed as early as 1590, it was not until the 1920s that it started to be explored extensively, although Steinitz essayed it in the first official World Chess Championship of 1886.</p>
