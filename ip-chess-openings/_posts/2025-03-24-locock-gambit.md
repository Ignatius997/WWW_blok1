The Locock Gambit is a very aggressive line in the Philidor Defense and starts with the moves:
1.e4 e5
2.Nf3 d6
3.d4 Nf6
4.Ng5 h6
5.Nxf7
The Philidor Defense is generally pretty passive. When you start out with e5 and d6 you are playing for a very long game by building up a strong pawn structure. This can be very frustrating for many players starting out with e4 because they are looking for an aggressive start.
