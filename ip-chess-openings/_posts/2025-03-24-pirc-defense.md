The Pirc Defense is a hypermodern defense, meaning that it doesnâ€™t try to control the center early on with his pawns. Instead black tries to attack the center with this minor pieces from the sides and then once the foundation is in place, then looks to undermine the center control that white usually has.
1.e4 d6
2.d4 Nf6
3.Nc3
There are two main attacks that white has to play against the Pirc Defense. The Austrian Attack is the most aggressive as white pushes his f pawn to f4, exposing a weakness on his king side but putting added pressure on the king side of black. It is usually a good idea to aggressively attack a king that is castled on the side of a fianchettoed bishop which black does in the Pirc defense with the moves g6 followed by Bg7.

The Pirc Defence, named after Slovenian grandmaster Vasja Pirc, is a relatively new opening; while it was seen on occasion in the late nineteenth century, it was considered irregular, thus remaining a sideline.
