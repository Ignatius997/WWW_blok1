# Chess Openings

#### The first few moves in the chess opening lays the foundation for every chess game. Most of the chess openings have been named and analyzed for hundreds of years. It is important if you want to be successful in chess to be familiar with some of the most popular openings and understand the theory behind the moves.



## Adelaide Counter Gambit

![Adelaide Counter Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/adelaide-counter-gambit.png)

The Adelaide Counter Gambit is a solid attack against the King’s Gambit for black and begins with the moves:
1.e4 e5
2.f4 Nc6
3.Nf3 f5
When white plays the King’s Gambit they are usually looking to give up material and then have the initiative for the early part of the game. This defense turns the tables on white and gives black multiple attacking lines and control of the center. White has to be careful because if they don’t play properly there are many traps they can fall into. Below are different options they have after 3…f5.

## Albin Counter-Gambit

![Albin Counter-Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/albin2.jpg)

The Albin Counter-Gambit is a hyper aggressive defense for black against the ever so popular queens gambit from white.
1. d4 d5
2. c4 e5
Black gives up his pawn on e5 so that his d pawn can be nicely placed on d4. This pawn is a huge thorn in the side of white and there are many trap that come from the Albin Counter-Gambit that white has to be on the lookout for. One of the most common traps in the Albin Counter-Gambit is the Lasker Trap which punishes white if he tries to attack the pawn on d4 with e3.

## Alekhine Defense

![Alekhine Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/alekhinedefensebig.jpg)

1. e4 Nf6
Black looks to allow white to chase his knight all over the board with tempo gaining pawn moves that will control the center of the board. In exchange for the center control, black will look to undermine the overextended pawns from white.
The one thing black must always remember is that after his knight has been chased around he no longer can play passively and instead needs to attack the center that white has built up or he will be crushed by the pressure white can build up.

## Belgrade Gambit

![Belgrade Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/belgrade-gambit.jpg)

The Belgrade Gambit is an aggressive line that derives from the Scotch Four Knights Game:
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Nc3 Nf6
4. d4 exd4
5. Nd5
White’s most common move after 4…exd4 is to recapture with 5. Nxd4 but Nd5 allows white to transition into the Belgrade Gambit. As with many less known gambits, the Belgrade gets much of its advantage from your opponent not being familiar with how to play correctly as black. The good thing about this variation is that if you play 1. e4 2. Nf3 you’ll get many opportunities to try this out as it’s fairly easy to transition into a four knights game.

## Benoni Defense

![Benoni Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/the-benoni-defense.jpg)

The Benoni Defense is a very aggressive line that black can play to counter the very common open by white d4. While many defenses against the queen pawn opening are closed and drawish, the Benoni Defense gives black many opportunities to not only equalize the position, but also to gain an advantage and play for the win.
1. d4 Nf6
2. c4 c5
3. d5
In the Modern Benoni Defense, the main focus of the game is white’s center control of the light squares with its key pawn on d5 and black’s control of the center from the dark squares. Black will usually fianchetto his bishop on the kingside to g7 to add extra support to the dark squares.

## Bird’s Opening

![Bird’s Opening](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/the-birds-opening.jpg)

The Bird’s Opening is the 6th most popular opening and is a very aggressive opening. White starts out weakening his king side and starts a flank attack on the center with his f pawn. This opening is not used in lots of top level play but some of the most beautiful games in chess history have been played using the Bird’s Opening.
1. f4
After black defends with d5 the game will transpose into a reverse of the Dutch defense, where white opens with d4 and black responds with f5. White’s main focus is on the dark squares in the game which is a big difference than the usual light squares that white usually focuses on.

## Bishop’s Opening

![Bishop’s Opening](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bishops-chess-opening.png)

The Bishop’s Opening is one of the oldest openings in chess but has fallen out of favor recently. It starts with the moves:
1. e4 e5
2. Bc4
White decides to develop the light square bishop before bringing the knight to f3. The three main responses from black are 2…Nf6, 2…Nc6, and 2…Bc5. White has good chances against each of these lines and can fall into more popular opening variations if they choose.

## Blackmar-Diemer Gambit

![Blackmar-Diemer Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/blackmar_big.jpg)

The Blackmar-Diemer Gambit is one of the most ambitious attempts for white to gain a developmental advantage.
1. d4 d5
2. e4 dxe4
3. Nc3
From the second move white looks to give away his king’s pawn. Although many top GM’s find this to be unsound, many club level players have great success with it and if you are a very aggressive player I recommend playing it from time to time.

## Bogo Indian Defense

![Bogo Indian Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bogo-indian-defense.png)

The Bogo Indian Defense is a chess opening that arrives after the starting moves:
1. d4 Nf6
2. c4 e6
3. Nf3 Bb4+
Many players with the white pieces will choose the third move Nf3 instead of Nc3 because they want to avoid the Nimzo Indian Defense. Black has multiple options after Nf3 but Bb4+ is a common move seen at all levels of play.

## Budapest Gambit

![Budapest Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/budapest_big.jpg)

The Budapest Gambit is one of the least common gambits but still offers black a lot of interesting play. In the main line for example, white can easily fall into a trap that ends in checkmate very early in the game.
1. d4 Nf6
2. c4 e5
In the second move, black looks to give up his pawn on e5 but then starts to develop of his pieces to add pressure on the e5 pawn. White will be unable to hold onto the extra pawn and therefore many times will just give back the pawn and continue to develop pieces and not worry about the pawn advantage.

## Calabrese Countergambit

![Calabrese Countergambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/the-calabrese-countergambit.jpg)

The Italian Game is white’s effort to quickly develop his light square bishop and dominate the center of the board. The Calabrese Countergambit is black’s way of giving up his f-pawn to completely thwart all of white’s game plan. The more aggressive white tries to be in the opening the more potential traps he can fall into.
1. e4 e5
2. Bc4 f5
Black usually ends up with a very strong center while white’s pieces struggle to find great squares to develop. White must play very precise or he can easily find himself in a lot of trouble.

## Caro-Kann

![Caro-Kann](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/the-caro-kann.jpg)

The Caro-Kann Defense is one of the most popular openings in response to the King’s Pawn Opening.
1. e4 c6
Black responds with 1….c6 with the idea of thrusting forward with d5 on the next move, attacking the white central pawn on e4. The Caro-Kann Defense is one of the few defenses in chess where black can reach equality in the main line and many people would consider black to have a better position, especially in the end game when the main line is played out. This is usually because black does not compromise his pawn structure and will usually have an easier end game.

## Colorado Gambit

![Colorado Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Colorado-Gambit.jpg)

The Colorado Gambit is an aggressive line in the Nimzowitsch Defence. Black looks to weaken his king side pawn structure in exchange for some deadly attacks against white. This is a solid opening for black but usually works best as a surprise opening against a player that hasn’t studied all of the lines.
1. e4 Nc6
2. Nf3 f5
White must play carefully as there are many traps and dangerous lines that black can play. Unlike other gambits, black would prefer that white not take the pawn on f5. Instead, black would like to control the center of the board with the f5 pawn and quickly development the rest of his pieces.

## Danish Gambit

![Danish Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DanishGambit.jpg)

The Danish Gambit is one of the most aggressive openings as white will look to sacrifice two pawns for quick development and the attack.
1.e4 e5
2.d4 exd4
3.c3
Many times you will see games with the Danish Opening last less than 20 moves as white will either breakthrough and checkmate the king early on or white will fail miserably and be left in shambles.

## Dutch Defense

![Dutch Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DutchDefense.jpg)

The Dutch Defense is a very active defense in chess against the Queen pawn opening.
1. d4 f5
Black looks to control the e4-square while completely unbalancing the position. Later on in the chess game, black will look to future his attack on white’s kingside. One of the key concepts is that the weak f7 square that black has becomes even more a target for white and many times white will focus exclusively on targeting this weakness. In return, black will have very active pieces that are not cramped and should provide for some exciting game play.

## Elephant Gambit

![Elephant Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/elephant-gambit.png)

The Elephant Gambit is an uncommon gambit that arrives after the starting moves:
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 d5
White can take either of the pawns on e5 or d5. Both of the pawns have the own unique challenges.

## English Opening

![English Opening](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/EnglishOpening.jpg)

The English opening is the 4th most common opening for white. Although the English has its own style, the opening is very flexible and many times transposes into other opening lines. The objective of the opening is to apply pressure on the center d5 square without committing the queen pawn or the king pawn. Since the move is a flank move many players like the English because of its hypermodern style of play (using pieces from the sides along with minor pieces to apply pressure and control the center).
White’s 2nd move depends on black’s response. If black does not immediately try to control the center white can fianchetto his bishop with 2. g3 3. Bg2 and white starts to apply even more pressure on the d5 square and gives white the control over the light squares. Many English games will start out very slow as both sides build up pressure around the center.
The good thing about the English is that you can be very versatile. With all the different openings that you can transpose into, the English can be used against any opponent as you can change your game plan early on. If you like slow methodical games and like to be flexible this is a great opening to use.

## Evans Gambit

![Evans Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/evansgambit1.jpg)

The Evans Gambit is an aggressive variation of the Giuoco Piano. For those players that like to play the Giuoco Piano I highly recommend playing the Evan’s Gambit.
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Bc4 Bc5
4. b4
Much like other gambits, the Evan’s Gambit gives up an early pawn in exchange for rapid development and a lead in center control. White actually scores better with the Evan’s Gambit than not playing the gambit and following the main lines of the Giuoco Piano which is why I recommend playing it.

## Falkbeer Counter-Gambit

![Falkbeer Counter-Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/falkbeer1.jpg)

The Falkbeer Counter-Gambit is one of the most aggressive openings for black. It is a direct counter attack against the King’s Gambit of white.
1. e4 e5
2. f4 d5
One of the great things about this counter is that it destroys all the lines that a king’s gambit player may have planned on using. There are also lots of traps that white will have to look out for as his king is very exposed even after the second move.

## French Defense

![French Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/French-Defense.jpg)

The French Defense is a sharp counterattacking weapon against white’s King Pawn opening.
1. e4 e6
From black’s first move, he looks to block the a2-g8 diagonal which is usually a big weakness for black and prepares to take control of the light squares in the center after 2.d5. Some of the greatest players of all time have had a hard time playing against the French Defense because it plays so much differently than a normal black defense.

## Fried Liver Attack

![Fried Liver Attack](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/fried-liver-attack-big.jpg)

The Fried Liver Attack is one of the most aggressive openings from white as you will be sacrificing one of your minor pieces very early in the game.
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Bc4 Nf6
4. Ng5
This aggressive attack starts from the Italian game and will play out if black chooses to defend with the two knights defense (as shown in the picture). If black chooses Bc5 instead of the two knights defense I recommend the Evan’s Gambit, since the fried liver attack will no longer work.

## Giuoco Piano

![Giuoco Piano](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/the-giuoco-piano.jpg)

The Giuoco Piano is said to be the oldest opening recorded in chess. Instead of developing the bishop to b5, white instead attacks the center and aims at the weak f7 square. After black responds bishop to c5 you see the tension building up in the center of the board.
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Bc4 Bc5
The opening has been called the “quiet game” but for anyone who has played this opening, after the initial build up in the center, the Giuoco Piano becomes anything but quiet. There will almost certainly be many exchanges in the middle as both sides vie for center control, opening the board up.

## Grob Attack

![Grob Attack](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/grob-attack.png)

The Grob Attack is not a common opening and many people think of it as one of white’s weakest opening choices because it doesn’t attack the center of the board and it weakens the king’s safety. It begins with the move:
1. g4
While this isn’t the strongest move from white there are still some interest lines that white can go down to put black in a tough spot. Black will normally respond to the Grob Attack with one of the following:

## Grunfeld Defense

![Grunfeld Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/grunfeld.jpg)

The Grunfeld Defense is a hypermodern defense, meaning that it doesn’t try to control the center early on with his pawns. Instead black tries to attack the center with this minor pieces from the sides and then once the foundation is in place, then looks to undermine the center control that white usually has.
1. d4 Nf6
2. c4 g6
3. Nc3 d5
There are three main lines in the Grunfeld Defense. The exchange variation is the main line and is what most players study for when approaching the Grunfeld Defense. Black allows white to completely dominate the center with his pawns while black focuses all his energy on the d4 square. Instead of using his spacial advantage in the center, white is forced to respond to the threat on d4 and focus all his energy on defending the d4 pawn. With all the pawns and pieces aimed at the center early on with no other strategy in mind, things can quickly turn for the worst if one of the sides looses focus.

## Halloween Gambit

![Halloween Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/HalloweenGambit.jpg)

The Halloween Gambit, or the Muller-Schulze Gambit derives from the Four Knights Game but then takes on a very aggressive approach as white sacrifices a knight for a pawn with the hopes of controlling the center with white’s pawns. White hopes to do this by driving back black’s knights while pushing forward his pawns.
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Nc3 Nf6
4. Nxe5
Even though black will be retreating his knights, black has more than enough compensation for white’s temporary advancement in the center. If black plays correctly, he should have a very good game.

## How to Counter Aggressive Openings – King’s Gambit

![How to Counter Aggressive Openings – King’s Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/17723-1710488420742-thumbnail-1.webp)

Let’s set the stage: White opens with 1.e4 e5, the board balanced and your pieces eyeing the center. Suddenly, White throws a curveball – 2.f4. Boom – that’s the King’s Gambit – a sacrificial gambit where White offers up the f4 pawn to gain rapid development and take control of the center.

## Icelandic Gambit

![Icelandic Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/icelandic-gambit.jpg)

The Icelandic Gambit is an aggressive alternative to the Scandinavian Defense.  Instead of taking the pawn on d5, black looks to give up the material in exchange for developmental lead and a semi-open file for his queen.
1. e4 d5
2. exd5 Nf6
3. c4 e6
White has to be very careful as the Icelandic Gambit has many different traps that one can fall into.  Black has all of his pieces positioned nicely while white has none of his pieces developed and a pawn structure that lacks substance going into an end game.

## Italian Game

![Italian Game](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/the-italian-game.jpg)

The Italian Game is one of the oldest openings in chess. After 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 white looks to centralize more material by bringing his bishop to c4. While this is a very active square early on, this opening can many times become a very quiet and slow game. Both sides of the board look to stabilize without trading off any material.
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Bc4
The good news is that there are many aggressive variations that white can play to open the game up. If black plays Bc5 then white can play the Evan’s Gambit (4. b4) or the Italian Gambit (4. d4).

## Jerome Gambit

![Jerome Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/jerome-gambit.jpg)

The Jerome Gambit is an extremely aggressive opening that usually derives from the Giuoco Piano. White sacrifices both his king side bishop and knight in exchange for an exposed king and the possibility of an aggressive attack. Moves usually start with:
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Bc4 Bc5
4. Bxf7+ Kxf7
5. Nxe5+ Nxe5
White usually continues with Qh5+. This gets the most important piece into the attack early and leaves black with the most possibilities to blunder. If black moves Ke7 or f6 then white is going to have a fairly easy game. The best move for black is Ke6 but it’s difficult to bring the king into the center of the board unless you are prepared for this opening.

## King’s Gambit

![King’s Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/KingsGambit.jpg)

The King’s Gambit is one of the oldest openings in chess and for good reason. The possibilities the opening presents have intrigued the greatest chess minds for years including greats such as Spassky, Tal, and Fischer. White, on the second move challenges black’s center and begins an attack at the black kingside.
1. e4 e5
2. f4
Black can accept or decline the gambit. Most players choose to accept the gambit and try to counterattack the now semi-exposed king side of white. If accepted white should focus their attention on the f7 square which is now a big weakness for black. After 2 exf4 white has two good options. The first option is to immediately start the attack with 3. Bc4, putting immediate pressure on the f7 square. The second option is 3. Nf3 which defends against 3 Qh4+ and also starts to develop an attack on the king side.

## Kings Indian Defense

![Kings Indian Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/kings-indian-defense-big.jpg)

The Kings Indian Defense is one of the most solid defenses in chess. Black builds an extremely strong defense around his king and then looks to counter attack depending on where white’s structure is weak.
Play normally starts in the Kings Indian Defense with the moves:
1. d4 Nf6

## Larsens Opening

![Larsens Opening](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/larsens-opening.jpg)

Larsens Opening is a change of pace from the typical openings where white looks to control the center of the board with this d and e pawns.  Instead white will play his bishop to b2 and control the dark square diagonal which will put pressure on black’s king side.
This is not an aggressive opening but does give white many favorable positions and also is poorly prepared for by black.
If white wants to play more aggressive he can always play e3 followed by f4 and start to push forward on the king side.  While e3 isn’t common, in Larsens Opening is makes a lot of sense because the dark square bishop is already out of the pawn chain on b2.

## Latvian Gambit

![Latvian Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/LatvianGambit_big.jpg)

The Latvian Gambit is a very aggressive opening defense for black against one of the more common openings for white. This opening is not seen much at master level chess as most masters refuse to give up material early on in a game. Below master level play there are strong advocates of the Latvian Gambit and I personally enjoy the possibilities that arise from this opening.
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 f5
What makes this is such an interesting opening is that white does not have many good moves besides accepting the gambit. If white refuses the gambit, black will have the same aggressive style of play with this f file open, potential for a castle rook, but also black will not be down in material. This is why it is far more common for white to accept the gambit with Nxe5. From here black has many options, all of which are very aggressive. Many Latvian Gambit games are filled with crazy and wild sacrifices. I would not recommend playing this opening if you are only looking to go down 1 pawn in material and claw back the rest of the game. The Latvian Gambit usually is an all out war, doing whatever it takes to checkmate your opponent, even if that means giving up a few pieces.

## Locock Gambit

![Locock Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/locock-gambit.png)

The Locock Gambit is a very aggressive line in the Philidor Defense and starts with the moves:
1.e4 e5
2.Nf3 d6
3.d4 Nf6
4.Ng5 h6
5.Nxf7
The Philidor Defense is generally pretty passive. When you start out with e5 and d6 you are playing for a very long game by building up a strong pawn structure. This can be very frustrating for many players starting out with e4 because they are looking for an aggressive start.

## Lolli Attack

![Lolli Attack](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/lolli-attack-opening-big.jpg)

The Lolli Attack is an aggressive opening for white in the Italian game when black defends with the two knights defense. Instead of immediately sacrificing the knight on f7, white instead plays d4, sacrificing another pawn and then castling kingside.
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Bc4 Nf6
4. Ng5 d5
5. exd5 Nxd5
6. d4 exd4
This is very similar to the Fried Liver Attack, but castling on the kingside gives white another powerful piece, the rook, involved into the attack. Regardless of how black defends, white will look to sacrifice his knight on f7 and the start the assault against the black king.

## London System

![London System](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/londonsystem_big.png)

The London System is a great chess opening for beginning chess players. It quickly develops the dark square bishop which is a very underutilized minor piece for white.
The opening doesn’t start out aggressive, and many times ends in a closed game, but it gives white lots of options and is very useful is stopping black from any counterattack.
The London System is extremely good against the King’s Indian Defense systems as black becomes cramped and is left with little room to do anything.

## Matinovsky Gambit

![Matinovsky Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/matinovsky-gambit-opening.jpg)

The Matinovsky Gambit is an aggressive line by black in the Owen’s Defense. It starts with the moves:
1. e4 b6
2. d4 Bb7
3. Bd3 f5
Black looks to give up the f pawn in exchange for an activated light squared bishop. Black can immediately take on g2 and threaten the h1 rook. If white plays correctly the rook on h1 will stay safe and should have a very good game. White should always accept the gambit but must make sure they are familiar with the opening or things can turn quickly in black’s favor.

## Muzio Gambit

![Muzio Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/muzio-gambit-big.jpg)

The Muzio Gambit is one of the most aggressive lines in the already aggressive King’s Gambit.
1. e4 e5
2. f4 exf4
3. Nf3 g5
4. Bc4 g4
5. 0-0
Instead of counter attacking with the knight on f3, white gives that knight up in exchange for a massive attack with his bishop, queen and castled king. Black is up in material but has a weakened king side and no developed pieces.

## Nakhmanson Gambit

![Nakhmanson Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Nakhmanson-Gambit.png)

The Nakhmanson Gambit is one of the most aggressive lines that white can take in the Italian Game. White looks to give up two pawns and a knight in exchange for rapid development and some deadly attacks on the black king. The opening usually starts with the moves:
1.e4 e5
2.Nf3 Nc6
3.Bc4 Nf6
4.d4 exd4
5.O-O Nxe4
6.Nc3
For this overview we will be looking the accepted lines after 6…dxc3 7. Bxf7 Kxf7 8. Qd5+. In this line white has given up two pawns, a knight, and now a bishop all for the thrill of a devastating attack on the black king.

## Nimzo Indian Defense

![Nimzo Indian Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/nimzo-indian-defense-big.jpg)

The Nimzo Indian Defense is an extremely solid defense that is seen at all levels of play. Many players playing as white will try different variations to try to avoid going into the Nimzo Indian Defense lines.
1. d4 Nf6
2. c4 e6
3. Nc3 Bb4
Black looks to double up the pawns on the c-file in exchange for his dark square bishop. With the knight on c3 the key defender of the e4 square, black really starts to focus his energy on controlling the e4 and the light squares.

## Petrov Defense

![Petrov Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Petrov.jpg)

The Petrov Defense, sometimes referred to as the Russian game is one of the more popular games with GMs because of its generally drawish tendencies. Many other players prefer to play the Petrov Defense so that they can avoid the lines of the Ruy Lopez, the Italian Game and the Scotch Game. For those players that like to play e5 but don’t like the normal defenses, then this might be a good alternative.
Black has to be careful with how he continues in the Petrov. If white captures on e5 then black can’t continue to mirror and take on e4 or he will end up being down in material. Instead black should first play d6, forcing the white knight back and then take on e4. If both sides want to open things up, then they can exchange knights on c3 which will usually result in a queenside castle for white and very aggressive play from both sides.
Watch the video below to get a detailed explanation of the Petrov Defense.

## Philidor Defense

![Philidor Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/philidor.jpg)

The Philidor Defense is an alternative move to the more common 2…Nc6 move from black. While very solid, it is extremely passive and thought to be a weaker option to Nc6. Because of this, it is rare to see at high level play.
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 d6
At lower levels of chess and even club levels the Philidor Defense is common so even if you don’t intend to play it yourself it’s always important to understand how to play against it.

## Pirc Defense

![Pirc Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/pirc.jpg)

The Pirc Defense is a hypermodern defense, meaning that it doesn’t try to control the center early on with his pawns. Instead black tries to attack the center with this minor pieces from the sides and then once the foundation is in place, then looks to undermine the center control that white usually has.
1.e4 d6
2.d4 Nf6
3.Nc3
There are two main attacks that white has to play against the Pirc Defense. The Austrian Attack is the most aggressive as white pushes his f pawn to f4, exposing a weakness on his king side but putting added pressure on the king side of black. It is usually a good idea to aggressively attack a king that is castled on the side of a fianchettoed bishop which black does in the Pirc defense with the moves g6 followed by Bg7.

## Ponziani Opening

![Ponziani Opening](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ponziani-big.jpg)

The ponziani opening begins with the moves
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. c3
White looks to build up a support for a later push of d4, controlling the dark squares in the center of the board.

## Queens Gambit

![Queens Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/QueensGambit-e1346610053936.jpg)

1. d4 d5
2. c4
The objective of the queen’s gambit is to temporarily sacrifice a pawn to gain control of the center of the board.
If black accepts the gambit 2…dxc4 white should reply 3. e3 which not only gives the d4 pawn an extra defender but also frees up the bishop to attack and regain the pawn. Black will have a hard time holding onto the pawn after 3…b5 4. a4 c6 5. axb5 cxb5 6. Qf3. In the Queen’s Gambit accepted line, white is able to gain a center presence, good attacking chances and his pawn on d4 threatens to advance. Black will have to concede his pawn on c4 and focus on counter attacking white’s advances. This is why the queen’s gambit is not considered to be a true gambit. There are many different variations for black if they choose to decline the gambit.

## Queens Indian Defense

![Queens Indian Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/queens-indian-defense.jpg)

The Queen’s Indian Defense is an extremely solid hypermodern defense against the d4 opening from white. It usually arises if white chooses to avoid the Nimzo-Indian defense by bringing his knight to c3 and instead opts to first bring his knight to f3.
1. d4 Nf6
2. c4 e6
3. Nf3 b6
Black prepares to fiachetto his light square bishop and try to take control over both the center light squares as well as the long diagonal.

## Reti Opening

![Reti Opening](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/RetiOpening.jpg)

The Reti Opening has at times been referred to as the Opening of the Future. It is called this because of how easy it is to transpose into a variety of different opening lines. Many players have a very defined defense as black but against the Reti, black is forced to almost wait and see which opening line white will take. Some of the main opening lines that the Reti will transpose into are the Queen’s Gambit, the English, the Ruy Lopez, or the King’s Indian Attack. As you can tell, white has many different options to choose from, even after he has already moved.
Most players are more comfortable moving a pawn on their first move as white to control the center but the Reti opening uses a flank technique to attack the center with its minor piece and allows for quick castling on the kingside.
White also puts pressure on the e5 square which black would like to occupy but white also does not commit to a specific center pawn structure.

## Ruy Lopez

![Ruy Lopez](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ruylopez.jpg)

The Ruy Lopez is the cornerstone of classical play in chess. There are probably more variations for the Ruy Lopez than any other opening. With the common use of the double king’s pawn opening (1.e4 e5), the Ruy Lopez is one of the most played openings that any chess player will come across. It’s almost imperative that any chess player study some of the more popular defenses against the Ruy Lopez and understand some of the key concepts of the opening.
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Bb5
From the beginning, white looks to develop his bishop while pinning down black’s knight to the king. Although many openings focus on the f7 square early on, the Ruy Lopez is a slower and more methodical approach to attacking black’s king.

## Scandinavian Defense

![Scandinavian Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/scandinavian.jpg)

The Scandinavian Defense is one of the oldest recorded openings in chess. From the very first move, black looks to undermine the center control of white after the common e4 move by white.
1. e4 d5
Nine times out of ten white will capture the pawn on d5 and I recommend that you spend the majority of your time learning the Scandinavian Defense, assuming that white captures the pawn on d5.

## Scotch Gambit

![Scotch Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/scotch-gambit1.jpg)

There are a few ways to offer a gambit as white in the Scotch Game.  The most common, and one that we will focus on this page, is white playing Bc4 instead of taking with his knight on d4.
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. d4 exd4
4. Bc4
This does many different things but it delays the middle control of the board with the knight and pawn in exchange for a very powerful bishop that eyes down on the f7 pawn from black.

## Scotch Game

![Scotch Game](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ScotchGame.jpg)

The Scotch Game has recently regained popularity as many top level players have used it as a surprise against players who are well equipped to face the Ruy Lopez. The Scotch is very similar to the Center Game where d4 opens up lines for development and also gives white early center control. In the Scotch Game, black will be able to develop easy and white should look to take advantage of its special and center control.
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. d4
Any chess player that likes to play 1.e4 should study the Scotch Game as there are many subtle traps that black can fall into that will give white an overwhelming advantage. Most players expect white to play 3.Bb5 or 3.Bc4 and when white instead transposes in the Scotch Game (3.d4), they sometimes will make amateur mistakes, leaving the door open for white to take control of the game.

## Semi-Slav

![Semi-Slav](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/semi-slav-big.jpg)

The Semi-Slav Defense is one of the most popular defenses for black against the Queen’s Gambit line from white. This opening is seen at all levels of chess competition and is often seen as one of the most sound defenses at top level play.
1.d4 d5
2.c4 c6
3.Nf3 Nf6
4.Nc3 e6
Black spends most of the time in the Semi-Slav developing pawns and pieces to control the light squares in the middle of the board. It differs from the Slav opening in that the light square bishop on c8 is not developed before the pawn structure is formed with e6. This allows more time for black to build up a solid pawn structure around the d5 pawn, but at the cost of slower development from his light square bishop.

## Sicilian Defense

![Sicilian Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/sicilian-big.jpg)

The Sicilian Defense is the most popular defense against white’s opening 1.e4 and is used extensively at top level play. It is a very aggressive defense and immediately stakes claim at the center, denying white the double pawns on e4 and d4. Many chess champions actually prefer to start with 1.d4 because of how well the Sicilian Defense plays against 1.e4.
Eventually the c-pawn of black is usually exchanged, opening the semi-open c file for black to bring his queen or rook to and add pressure to the queen side attack.
White not only has to worry about black’s defense but also the counter attack that the Sicilian Defense presents. White tends to have the advantage on the king side while black will usually look to attack on the queen side.

## Slav Defense

![Slav Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/slav_big.jpg)

The Slav Defense is one of the most popular openings with GM’s. This is for two reasons. The first is that it is one of the most solid lines to play against the Queens Gambit and with the Queens Gambit being a regular opening at high level play, many top players have become fans of this opening.
1. d4 d5
2. c4 c6
The Slav also allows for lots of different variations so those players that like to be creative and don’t like to play the same variation every game will really enjoy the Slav Defense because it offers just that.

Before we dive into the waters of the Geller Gambit, let’s set the baseline. Picture the classic Queen’s Gambit. White moves 1.d4, asserting control in the center, and then follows up with 2.c4. This demands a response, and here’s where Black counters with the steadfast Slav Defense by playing 2…c6.

## Smith Morra Gambit

![Smith Morra Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/smithmorra_big.jpg)

The Smith Morra Gambit is a sharp and aggressive line against the Sicilian Defense from black. If you play e4 as white for any length of time you probably run into the Sicilian Defense quite often.
1. e4 c5
2. d4 cxd4
3. c3 dxc3
4. Nxc3
This gambit is only for very aggressive players as are most gambits. White looks to not only take black out of the normal Sicilian lines but also looks to use the advantage in development to overwhelm the black king.

The Tennison Gambit is an aggressive line against the Scandinavian defense that starts with the moves:
1. e4 d5
2. Nf3
Black is almost always going to capture the pawn on e4 and white should respond with Ng5. This puts black in an interesting position. If black tries to hold onto the pawn advantage there are many lines where black will forfeit his position or even the lead in material.

## The Alien Gambit Trap

![The Alien Gambit Trap](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-alienmp4-1.webp)

The dance begins with the classic 1.e4. In response, Black sets the stage for the Caro-Kann, steering the pawn to c6. The plan? To challenge White’s central dominance with …d5. White, however, is undeterred and solidifies their grasp on the center with d4.

The Traxler counter attack derives from the two knights defense from black after white develops into the Italian game.
After white moves his knight to g5, attacking the weakened f7 square, black counter attacks with Bc5, disregarding his own safety for a lethal attack on white’s king side.
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Bc4 Nf6
4. Ng5 Bc5

## Urusov Gambit

![Urusov Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/urusov-gambit.jpg)

The Urusov Gambit is an aggressive line in the Bishop’s opening that starts with the moves:
1. e4 e5
2. Bc4 Nf6
3. d4
Instead of playing the normal Nc3 or Nf3, white looks to add pressure to the center of the board with d4 and open up more lanes for white’s remaining pieces to get involved into the attack. Black has two responses. Black taking on e4 with his knight is definitely a worse move. White can play dxe5 and then start to attack the knight on e4.

The Wing Gambit can be found in multiple opening lines. This page is specifically looking at the Wing Gambit in the Sicilian Defense. It starts with the moves:
1. e4 c5
2. b4
White looks to give up the b pawn in exchange for the removal of black’s dangerous c pawn in the Sicilian Defense. Usually black will take the pawn on b4 and white will continue with a3.
