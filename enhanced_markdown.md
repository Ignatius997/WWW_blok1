The Adelaide Counter Gambit is a solid attack against the King’s Gambit for black and begins with the moves:
1.e4 e5
2.f4 Nc6
3.Nf3 f5
When white plays the King’s Gambit they are usually looking to give up material and then have the initiative for the early part of the game. This defense turns the tables on white and gives black multiple attacking lines and control of the center. White has to be careful because if they don’t play properly there are many traps they can fall into. Below are different options they have after 3…f5.

## Albin Counter-Gambit

![Albin Counter-Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/albin2.jpg)

The Albin Counter-Gambit is a hyper aggressive defense for black against the ever so popular queens gambit from white.
1. d4 d5
2. c4 e5
Black gives up his pawn on e5 so that his d pawn can be nicely placed on d4. This pawn is a huge thorn in the side of white and there are many trap that come from the Albin Counter-Gambit that white has to be on the lookout for. One of the most common traps in the Albin Counter-Gambit is the Lasker Trap which punishes white if he tries to attack the pawn on d4 with e3.

## Alekhine Defense

![Alekhine Defense](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/alekhinedefensebig.jpg)

1. e4 Nf6
Black looks to allow white to chase his knight all over the board with tempo gaining pawn moves that will control the center of the board. In exchange for the center control, black will look to undermine the overextended pawns from white.
The one thing black must always remember is that after his knight has been chased around he no longer can play passively and instead needs to attack the center that white has built up or he will be crushed by the pressure white can build up.

Alekhine's Defense isn't the most common way for Black to meet 1.e4, but it is effective in the right hands, and logical in its goal of creating targets in the opposing side's center.

## Belgrade Gambit

![Belgrade Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/belgrade-gambit.jpg)

The Belgrade Gambit is an aggressive line that derives from the Scotch Four Knights Game:
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Nc3 Nf6
4. d4 exd4
5. Nd5
White’s most common move after 4…exd4 is to recapture with 5. Nxd4 but Nd5 allows white to transition into the Belgrade Gambit. As with many less known gambits, the Belgrade gets much of its advantage from your opponent not being familiar with how to play correctly as black. The good thing about this variation is that if you play 1. e4 2. Nf3 you’ll get many opportunities to try this out as it’s fairly easy to transition into a four knights game.

The Benoni Defense is a very aggressive line that black can play to counter the very common open by white d4. While many defenses against the queen pawn opening are closed and drawish, the Benoni Defense gives black many opportunities to not only equalize the position, but also to gain an advantage and play for the win.
1. d4 Nf6
2. c4 c5
3. d5
In the Modern Benoni Defense, the main focus of the game is white’s center control of the light squares with its key pawn on d5 and black’s control of the center from the dark squares. Black will usually fianchetto his bishop on the kingside to g7 to add extra support to the dark squares.
