## Falkbeer Counter-Gambit

![Falkbeer Counter-Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/falkbeer1.jpg)

The Falkbeer Counter-Gambit is one of the most aggressive openings for black. It is a direct counter attack against the King’s Gambit of white.
1. e4 e5
2. f4 d5
One of the great things about this counter is that it destroys all the lines that a king’s gambit player may have planned on using. There are also lots of traps that white will have to look out for as his king is very exposed even after the second move.
