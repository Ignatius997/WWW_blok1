The Queenâ€™s Indian Defense is an extremely solid hypermodern defense against the d4 opening from white. It usually arises if white chooses to avoid the Nimzo-Indian defense by bringing his knight to c3 and instead opts to first bring his knight to f3.
1. d4 Nf6
2. c4 e6
3. Nf3 b6
Black prepares to fiachetto his light square bishop and try to take control over both the center light squares as well as the long diagonal.
