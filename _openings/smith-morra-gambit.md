## Smith Morra Gambit

![Smith Morra Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/smithmorra_big.jpg)

The Smith Morra Gambit is a sharp and aggressive line against the Sicilian Defense from black. If you play e4 as white for any length of time you probably run into the Sicilian Defense quite often.
1. e4 c5
2. d4 cxd4
3. c3 dxc3
4. Nxc3
This gambit is only for very aggressive players as are most gambits. White looks to not only take black out of the normal Sicilian lines but also looks to use the advantage in development to overwhelm the black king.
