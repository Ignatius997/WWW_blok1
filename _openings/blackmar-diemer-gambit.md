## Blackmar-Diemer Gambit

![Blackmar-Diemer Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/blackmar_big.jpg)

The Blackmar-Diemer Gambit is one of the most ambitious attempts for white to gain a developmental advantage.
1. d4 d5
2. e4 dxe4
3. Nc3
From the second move white looks to give away his king’s pawn. Although many top GM’s find this to be unsound, many club level players have great success with it and if you are a very aggressive player I recommend playing it from time to time.
