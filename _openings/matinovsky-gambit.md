## Matinovsky Gambit

![Matinovsky Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/matinovsky-gambit-opening.jpg)

The Matinovsky Gambit is an aggressive line by black in the Owen’s Defense. It starts with the moves:
1. e4 b6
2. d4 Bb7
3. Bd3 f5
Black looks to give up the f pawn in exchange for an activated light squared bishop. Black can immediately take on g2 and threaten the h1 rook. If white plays correctly the rook on h1 will stay safe and should have a very good game. White should always accept the gambit but must make sure they are familiar with the opening or things can turn quickly in black’s favor.
