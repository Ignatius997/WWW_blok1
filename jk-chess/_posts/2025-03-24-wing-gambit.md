The Wing Gambit can be found in multiple opening lines. This page is specifically looking at the Wing Gambit in the Sicilian Defense. It starts with the moves:
1. e4 c5
2. b4
White looks to give up the b pawn in exchange for the removal of blackâ€™s dangerous c pawn in the Sicilian Defense. Usually black will take the pawn on b4 and white will continue with a3.
