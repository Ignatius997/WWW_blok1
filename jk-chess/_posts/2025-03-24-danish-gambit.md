## Danish Gambit

![Danish Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DanishGambit.jpg)

The Danish Gambit is one of the most aggressive openings as white will look to sacrifice two pawns for quick development and the attack.
1.e4 e5
2.d4 exd4
3.c3
Many times you will see games with the Danish Opening last less than 20 moves as white will either breakthrough and checkmate the king early on or white will fail miserably and be left in shambles.
