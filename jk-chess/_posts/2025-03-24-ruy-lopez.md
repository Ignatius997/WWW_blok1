## Ruy Lopez

![Ruy Lopez](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ruylopez.jpg)

The Ruy Lopez is the cornerstone of classical play in chess. There are probably more variations for the Ruy Lopez than any other opening. With the common use of the double king’s pawn opening (1.e4 e5), the Ruy Lopez is one of the most played openings that any chess player will come across. It’s almost imperative that any chess player study some of the more popular defenses against the Ruy Lopez and understand some of the key concepts of the opening.
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Bb5
From the beginning, white looks to develop his bishop while pinning down black’s knight to the king. Although many openings focus on the f7 square early on, the Ruy Lopez is a slower and more methodical approach to attacking black’s king.
