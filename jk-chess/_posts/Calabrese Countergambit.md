The Italian Game is white’s effort to quickly develop his light square bishop and dominate the center of the board. The Calabrese Countergambit is black’s way of giving up his f-pawn to completely thwart all of white’s game plan. The more aggressive white tries to be in the opening the more potential traps he can fall into.
1. e4 e5

Black usually ends up with a very strong center while white’s pieces struggle to find great squares to develop. White must play very precise or he can easily find himself in a lot of trouble.
