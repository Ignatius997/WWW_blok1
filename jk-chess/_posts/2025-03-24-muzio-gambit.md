The Muzio Gambit is one of the most aggressive lines in the already aggressive Kingâ€™s Gambit.
1. e4 e5
2. f4 exf4
3. Nf3 g5
4. Bc4 g4
5. 0-0
Instead of counter attacking with the knight on f3, white gives that knight up in exchange for a massive attack with his bishop, queen and castled king. Black is up in material but has a weakened king side and no developed pieces.
