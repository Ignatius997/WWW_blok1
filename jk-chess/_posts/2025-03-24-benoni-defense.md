## Benoni Defense

The Benoni Defense is a very aggressive line that black can play to counter the very common open by white d4. While many defenses against the queen pawn opening are closed and drawish, the Benoni Defense gives black many opportunities to not only equalize the position, but also to gain an advantage and play for the win.
1. d4 Nf6
2. c4 c5
3. d5
In the Modern Benoni Defense, the main focus of the game is white’s center control of the light squares with its key pawn on d5 and black’s control of the center from the dark squares. Black will usually fianchetto his bishop on the kingside to g7 to add extra support to the dark squares.
