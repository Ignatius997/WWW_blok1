## Scotch Gambit

There are a few ways to offer a gambit as white in the Scotch Game.Â  The most common, and one that we will focus on this page, is white playing Bc4 instead of taking with his knight on d4.
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. d4 exd4
4. Bc4
This does many different things but it delays the middle control of the board with the knight and pawn in exchange for a very powerful bishop that eyes down on the f7 pawn from black.
