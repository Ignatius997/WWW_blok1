The Dutch Defense is a very active defense in chess against the Queen pawn opening.
1. d4 f5
Black looks to control the e4-square while completely unbalancing the position. Later on in the chess game, black will look to future his attack on whiteâ€™s kingside. One of the key concepts is that the weak f7 square that black has becomes even more a target for white and many times white will focus exclusively on targeting this weakness. In return, black will have very active pieces that are not cramped and should provide for some exciting game play.
