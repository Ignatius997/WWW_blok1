## Halloween Gambit

![Halloween Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/HalloweenGambit.jpg)

The Halloween Gambit, or the Muller-Schulze Gambit derives from the Four Knights Game but then takes on a very aggressive approach as white sacrifices a knight for a pawn with the hopes of controlling the center with white’s pawns. White hopes to do this by driving back black’s knights while pushing forward his pawns.
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Nc3 Nf6
4. Nxe5
Even though black will be retreating his knights, black has more than enough compensation for white’s temporary advancement in the center. If black plays correctly, he should have a very good game.
