## Fried Liver Attack

![Fried Liver Attack](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/fried-liver-attack-big.jpg)

The Fried Liver Attack is one of the most aggressive openings from white as you will be sacrificing one of your minor pieces very early in the game.
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Bc4 Nf6
4. Ng5
This aggressive attack starts from the Italian game and will play out if black chooses to defend with the two knights defense (as shown in the picture). If black chooses Bc5 instead of the two knights defense I recommend the Evanâ€™s Gambit, since the fried liver attack will no longer work.
