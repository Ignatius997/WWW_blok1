The Wing Gambit can be found in multiple opening lines. This page is specifically looking at the Wing Gambit in the Sicilian Defense. It starts with the moves:
1. e4 c5
2. b4
White looks to give up the b pawn in exchange for the removal of blackâ€™s dangerous c pawn in the Sicilian Defense. Usually black will take the pawn on b4 and white will continue with a3.


### Duckduckgo results about Wing Gambit

The Wing Gambit can also be played against the French Defence, although this is largely refuted at the grandmaster level.One line, as popularised by Gotham Chess, [2] goes 1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.e5 c5 4.b4, and Black often takes cxb4, followed by White's a3 with a further gambit of a pawn in exchange for quick development of the minor pieces, and/or d4 and c3 to solidify the centre.
